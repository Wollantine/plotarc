# plotarc
Let me be your weapon: String your plot's arrows, aim at the core of your
story, and trace an arc to hit your readers' hearts right in the middle.

## What is Plotarc
Plotarc (WIP) is a note manager right now in development.

Just like other note managers, it allows to save and edit small pieces of text
with a title and organize them.

Unlike other note managers, it allows to tag a note with other notes, creating
a multi-dimensional database you can later query however you please.

## Motivation
Plotarc's idea was born from the need to organize the information related to
novel and story writing. The need to note down all characters, chapters,
scenes, plot threads, and so on, and relate them completely so one can ask
things like:
- List of scenes by chapter
- List of scenes where a character appears
- Schema of the scenes of each plot thread that allows to see where two coincide
- Timeline of events ordered by date or by scene
- ...
